# Auto-Tuning Line Following PID

This script improves **PID-based line following** by **dynamically adjusting** P, I, and D values based on sensor feedback.

## Features

- **Automatically adjusts P, I, and D values** for better corrections.
- **Works on different tracks without manual tuning.**
- **Uses real-time color sensor feedback.**

## How to Use

1. **Upload `auto_tuning_line_following_PID.py`** to your SPIKE Prime hub.
2. **Run the script** and watch the robot follow the line.
3. **Modify `MAX_P`, `MAX_I`, `MAX_D`** for different track conditions.

## Adjusting PID Values

Modify these values for **better performance**
